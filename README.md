# ageing-simulation
Simulation analyses of ageing data to compare age-length pairs and growth increments.

## script to simulate how ages are obtained from surveys and commercial activities
The folder "simulating-observations" contains the simulations of how ageing data is collected from surveys and commercial activities. 

## models to analyse the age-length pairs
Typically, age-length observations are analysed using a growth model such as the von Bertalanffy model. See folder "age-length-analyses".

## models to analyses the growth increments
In addition to the age-length observations, growth increments provide the growth trajectory of a single individual over its lifetime. To obtain information about growth using these trajectories requires a different type of analyses. See folder "growth-increment-analyses".

## performance indicators 
To compare the two approaches and how they may consistitute trade-offs of how to obtain information about growth, a measurable indicator to rank the strategies is necessary.
